Hi Raza,

We have our first assignment ready for you.  It should be a fairly easy and straight-forward assignment that I would assume would take you one day to complete.  We need to create a new email template using the mustache templating framework that we have been using.

The new template is named venuechange.mustache.  I have created an unformatted version of the template.  Please format the message using the new_host_event.mustache file as a template.  A few things to note:

1) No headline (like the one in invitation.mustache) is required
2) Format for date is mmm. dd, yyyy  (ex. Oct. 23, 2012)
3) The link to the event details page should be formatted the same way it is in the invitation template.
4) Please create a text file with sample data so that we can preview and test the template prior to implementation.
5) I have placed a copy of this file as well as venuechange.mustache and new_host_event.mustache
